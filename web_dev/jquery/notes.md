**Notes to tackle JQuerry**

  * ask my expert friends
  * research some of their suggestions (if relevant)
  * look up the differences between JQ and JS
  * test some code
  * take action, make my own

**Action**

  * did my best to make a project for a slide show kinda deal, but I don't understand why it was unsuccessful...
